# Machine Learning Pipeline

Machine Learning Pipeline: template and examples in Python. Any typical Anaconda installation will be enough to run it through (mostly Pandas and scikit-learn).

## Folder 0: Raw work in Jupyter Notebook 

## Folder 1: Turn Jupyter notebook to primitive Python code files

```
python train.py   
python score.py
```

## Folder 2: Customized pipeline: put everything in Class

```
python pipeline.py 
```

## Folder 3: The standard scikit-learn pipeline

Extend scikit-learn's two basic classes, [**BaseEstimator**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.base.BaseEstimator.html) and [**TransformerMix**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.base.TransformerMixin.html) for customized transformation.

```
python train_pipeline.py  
python predict.py 
```
